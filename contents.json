You can request free open-source license similarly to Atlassian products [here](http://www.atlassian.com/software/views/open-source-license-request), see Marketplace Add-on option.\n\nYou can try/buy timesheet plugin on [Atlassian marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin) or from Jira itself, see this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofocpgsf-AY) for example.\n\nHowever, it's not possible to buy it directly in a few countries (mainly India) as described [here](http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#generalmarketplacequestions-12). Please, contact one of the Atlassian Experts listed on [this page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CUST/Marketplace+-+How+to+Purchase) instead, who can help you facilitate the purchase.\n\n## How does licensing work? \n\nYou have to buy license for continued use. It includes 12 months of maintenance. Renewing license is at 50% of the current purchase price, and is optional and needed for receiving updates.\n\nAlso, there are few functionality restrictions with no valid license. You'll see UNREGISTERED all the time and few things will not be available:\n\n1. [Plugin Configuration](Plugin_Configuration) in Administration -> Add-Ons\n1. [Subscribtions to Timesheet Report]((Email_Time_Sheet_Report)), to receive it by email\n1. [Worked Time Chart](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/416)\n1. [Timesheet Holidays](Timesheet_Holidays)\n1. Plugin updates notification. \n\nNote, you can ask for help, vote or request new features [here](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issues?status=new&status=open) or via email, disregarding license validity."

See [Advanced Searching - Fields reference](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/advanced-searching-fields-reference-433395081.html#Advancedsearching-fieldsreference-WorkLogAuthorworklogAuthorWorklogauthor).\n\nFor `worklogDate` valid formats include: `'YYYY/MM/DD'`, `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, or a period format e.g. `'-5d'`, `'4w 2d'`, or date function, e.g. `endOfDay()` for `Today`.\n\nFor `worklogAuthor` username or `membersOf()` can be used.\n\nSo, request can look like the following:\n\n    GET /rest/api/2/search?fields=*all&jql=filter=10001 and worklogDate > '2016-03-01' and worklogDate < endOfDay() and worklogAuthor in

      "text": "This page is intended to describe some non-trivial use cases that are possible with Timesheet and Pivot reports.\n\n## Entering time right from JIRA dashboard\n\nUsing Time Sheet Summary gadget  in single user mode, currently logged in user can log worked ours from dashboard. Time can be entered for previously worked issues, or any issues matching filter configured in Administration - Add-ons - Timesheet Configuration with [In Progress issues](Plugin_Configuration#In_Progress_issues) option.\n\n## Timesheet report for multiple users in summarized form\n\nReport show totals by user, if you check 'Show details' option. Also take a look at Project Pivot report shipped with the plugin, it just shows total worked hours, but with no \"group by project\".\n\nSo, since version 2.3.16, there is 'Worked User' pseudo field to be used in `Group By Field` report configuration option, so report will show summary by user  additionally, also grouped by project, and disregarding 'Show details' option.\n\n## Timesheet for project users\n\nThere are `Group` and `Role` configuration options in both reports and gadgets. They provide view for subset of users. Also in Timesheet gadget, when `Group` is selected all users in group will be shown, but if `Role` is selected only users that have logged hours will be shown. In report, with `'Show Details'` enabled, all worklog details will be shown separately per user.\n\nSince version 2.3.15 it is possible to see timesheet for project users if project is selected, and no target user is specified. Although it is possible to specify Group and/or Role, they will be used to narrow down project users subset.\n\nNote, it does not include users from Users role. So, if you'd like to have view for it, it's necessary to select Users project role instead.\n\nAnd before version 2.3.15, to display worked hours for project users, it's necessary to select project role that contains only relevant users.\n\nNote, before version 2.8.3.4 gadget configuration has combined `Project or Filter`, used to limit issues  displayed in gadget.\n\n### Timesheet limited to project\n\nThough, if you'd like to see timesheet for currently logged in user limited to project, workaround now is to create filter for only project issues, e.g. `Project = myproject`, and use the filter in `Project or Filter` configuration.\n\n## Weekly Report\n\nIf you don't specify Start/End dates, you may bookmark report URL and get time data for last week, up to the current date.\n\nAlso since version 2.8.0.2 it is possible to add `reportingDay` url parameter, to make report behave like gadget, i.e. show time spent for the current week, up to next Monday, or any other day you specify. E.g. `reportingDay=1` for Monday.\n\nSince version 2.9.3 there is support for `numOfWeeks`, `offset` and `monthView` url parameters for time period in reports also, thus different date ranges than a week are possible.\n\nE.g., you'd like timesheet report about whole previous month. So you need to specify `offset=-1` and `numOfWeeks=1` with `monthView=true` and keep other parameters specified normally in report configuration, so the url should be, something like the following:\n\n    ConfigureReport.jspa?offset=-1&numOfWeeks=1&weekends=true&monthView=true&reportKey=jira-timesheet-plugin%3Areport&Next=Next\n\nNote, the easiest way to compose correct report url is to click *Details* link in corresponding gadget, when it shows variable time window you'd like to get in the report.\n\n## Billable vs. non-billable time\n\nIf you have custom field, you can use filter with `'your_custom_field is not null'` or `'your_custom_field = BILL'` clause for example, then use the filter in a report or gadget to get only paid hours. Also if you'd like to show both billable and non-billable hours, you can select your field in Additional fields' and do manual processing in excel view. Or, select your field in `Group by` option, to immediately see aggregated billable and non-billable hours.\n\nAlso, you could differentiate hours by project roles or users, using `Group by` `Role` or `Worked User`.\n\n## Timetracking additional field in the reports\n\nYou may select a number of Additional fields to show extra information in Timesheet or Pivot report. And `'Time Tracking'` field will nicely display time spent along with remaining time per issue. E.g.:\n\n![Timetracking Field](http://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/wiki/Tips%20and%20Tricks/TimetrackingField.png)\n\n## Role additional field\n\nSince version 2.3.15 it is possible to add Role as additional field into Timesheet report (see in the very bottom of Additional fields, as it is pseudo field), or use it for grouping, also in Timesheet gadget.\n\n## Accumulate hours over issues\n\nSum SubTasks report configuration option makes reports to aggregate logged hours and any numeric Aditional Fields into parent task, using native JIRA SubTasks feature, and optionally JIRA Agile Epic Links, and optionally custom Issue Linking, see corresponding options in [Plugin Configuration](Plugin_Configuration).\n\nAlternatively, using Group By report option,reports aggregate logged hours and any numeric Additional Field for the grouped issues, and display in corresponding report section. Also using Collapse groups option, it's possible to get overall total.\n\nFinally, report total section beside summing up logged hours, aggregates any numeric Additional Fields too.\n\n## Leaves\n\nPlugin has support for public holidays, see [Timesheet Holidays](Timesheet_Holidays). But for personal holidays or sick leaves, it does not have special support, but there is a workaround - create separate project (say Internal) and a few issues for different kind of leaves, and let users log hours on it.\n"

      "text": "Since version [2.4](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b202) it's possible to change following plugin configuration options without JIRA restart needed. \nTimesheet Plugin Configuration is available in Administration, Plugins menu in JIRA 5, or Add-ons tab in JIRA 6. Note, those options that were previously advanced configuration options are still backed up with jira-config.properties for backward compatibility.\n\n## Timesheet Auditors Group\n\nThis option is intended to restrict access to Timesheet and Project Pivot to users group. When specified, only users of the group will be allowed to view Timesheet and Pivot assets for other users.\n\n## Timesheet Restricted Groups\n\nThis options allows to restrict visibility of other users worked hours to same group members. Users in the selected groups will see worked hours of other users in the same group only.\n\n## Timesheet Auditors Role\n\nThis option provides more granular restrictions access to Timesheet and Project Pivot for other users. If specified, only issues that match specified role will be shown to user in Timesheet and Pivot assets for other users.\n\nPlease see [Issue#453](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/453) and [specification](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai6BFV79vBqqdFpNbGs2cHlvVlF0bVFYXzJDOWI2LVE) for rules for all these three options.\n\n## Composition Issue Link\n\n\"Sum Subtasks\" reports and gadgets configuration option by default uses JIRA built in sub-tasks, which have one level hierarchy. But using 'is composed of' issue link for sub tasks, Timesheet and Pivot reports can aggregate hours, into parent task. Note, hours are aggregated into root task, transitively via Sub-tasks, Compose Issue Link and also Epic Link from JIRA Agile, since version 2.7, if `Parrent Issue Field` option is configured, see below.\n\nNote, this option is backed up with the following property in jira-config.properties. Sample usage:\n\n    jira.timesheet.plugin.composeIssueLink = Compose\n\nSee also issue [#301](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/301/time-301-ability-to-aggregate-time)\n\n## Parent Issue Field\n\nAllows to aggregate hours into JIRA Agile Epic issue, when using `Sum subtasks` report or gadget configuration option. \n\n## In Progress issues\n\nTo quickly add worklog for the issues currently in work, see this option to make Timesheet gadget for yourself show `In Progress` issues in current week. It is necessary to specify JQL query, e.g. `assignee = currentUser() and status = 'In Progress'`.\n\nIf you want more flexibility, consider using labels for this, e.g. JQL: `labels in (stick_in_timesheet)`. So if you want to make some issue appear in timesheet regardless previous worklogs, just add `stick_in_timesheet` label to it.\n\nOr there is super flexible trick, e.g. JQL: `filter = \"Sticky Issues for Timesheet\"`. So everyone can create a filter with this name, to whatever he or she wants. If filter does not exist for a user, nothing happens. Also you can share filters with certain users or groups to simplify their lives.\n\nSince version [2.9.3](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b1200) there is Show Empty Rows option in Time Sheet Gadget configuration, that works in combination with Filter gadget configuration option, so that issues matching the Filter selected are shown with or without work logged yet.\n\nSince version [2.8.2.3](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b886) till [2.9.3](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b1200) it is possible to use Timesheet gaget filter option instead of global JQL query.\n\nSee also issue [#475](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/475/show-issues-without-a-current-worklog), and issue [#537](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/537/allow-issues-to-be-displayed-regardless-of).\n\nNote before version `2.7.6`, option uses JQL Clause, e.g. `status = 'In Progress'`. The clause is prepended with `assignee = currentUser() and`.\n\nNote, this option is backed up with `jira.timesheet.plugin.inProgressClause` property from jira-config.properties. E.g.\n\n    jira.timesheet.plugin.inProgressClause=status='In Progress'\n\nSee also issue [#317](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/317).\n\n## Maximum Period Limit\n\nUse this option to increase limit of maximum days in Timesheet Report or gadget.\n\nSee also Issue [#169](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/169/time-169-unbounded-report-size-means-large)\n\nNote, this option is backed up with `jira.timesheet.plugin.maxDays` property from jira-config.properties. E.g.\n\n    jira.timesheet.plugin.maxDays=360\n\n## Pretty Duration format\n\nObsolete since [2.9.8](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b1630), please see `Duration Format` instead.\n\n## Duration Format\n\nDuration format to display hours. E.g. '1d 2h 30m' in case of Pretty Duration, 1.2d in case of Days, or 10.5h by default.\n\nNote, this option is backed up with `jira.timesheet.plugin.prettyDuration` property from jira-config.properties. E.g.\n\n    jira.timesheet.plugin.prettyDuration = true\n\nSee also issue[#202](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/202) and issue#e[#1051](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/1051).\n\nSince version [2.9.4](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b1330) it is possible to set `Pretty Duration` option per user in `Timesheet Preferences` in `User Profile`.\n\nBefore version [2.9.8](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b1630) option is just `Pretty Duration Format`.\n\n## Show Total In Front\n\nCheck this option to make plugin show `Total` column in front also in all gadgets and reports. It is also possible to set this option per user in `Timesheet Preferences` in `User Profile`.\n\nSince version [2.9.4](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b1330).\n\n## Highlight Hours\n\n If set, the value is used to highlight hours in Time Sheet Report under/over the threshold.\n\n Additionally, if using `Remind Users` in `Groups` option of [Timesheet Email Subscriptions](Email_Time_Sheet_Report), there will be a notice in users' report email if there is incomplete day, i.e. day total is lower than the value specified in the Highlight Hours plugin configuration option.\n\nSince version [2.9.5](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b1355) it is possible to set `Highlight Hours` option per user in `Timesheet Preferences` in `User Profile`.\n\n## Favorite filters\n\nIt may be not possible or convenient to show all filters, especially in case of too many filters in JIRA. So `Favorite filters` option allows to restrict Filter option in gadgets and reports to current user favorite filters.\n\n## Restrict Group by Field and Additional fields selectors\n\nThis options restricts contents of `Group By Field` and `Additional field` selectors in Timesheet Report configuration to the selected fields. \n\nNote, this option is backed up with `jira.plugin.timesheet.groupbyfields` property in `jira-config.properties`. E.g.\n\n    jira.plugin.timesheet.groupbyfields = Environment,Reporter\n\n## Restrict Project selector\n\nThis options excludes selected projects from `Project` selectors in plugin reports and gadgets configurations.\n\nAvailable from version 2.5.\n\n## Weekends\n\nIt is possible to define weekends style in Administration - Add-Ons - Timesheet Plugin Configuration, see `Weekends` configuration option. It supports standard (Sat-Sun), Islamic (Fri-Sat), Indian (Sun) and Solar (Fri) weekend types.\n\nAvailable from version 2.6.\n\n## Time Sheet header Day Format\n\nChanging \"Date/Time Formats\" in JIRA (Administration->Look and Feel) influences format in tooltips (when you mouse over timesheet header). However if you'd like to change date format in the timesheet header itself, you need to set `Day Format 1` and/or `Day Format 2` configuration options.\n\nAvailable from version 2.6.3.\n\nNote, these options are backed up with `jira.timesheet.plugin.dayFormat1=E` and `jira.timesheet.plugin.dayFormat2=dd/MMM` (default values are shown) in `jira-config.properties`.\n\n## Decimal separator for hours\n\nDecimal separator is determined by (your) locale settings. However, you may change it for all users. I.e. it affects whole plugin - all gadgets and both html and excel views for all reports.\n\nAvailable from version 2.6.3.\n\nNote, this option is backed up in `jira-config.properties`. E.g. to use coma instead of period (7,5h  instead of 7.5h):\n\n    jira.timesheet.plugin.decimalSeparator = ,\n\nSee also issue [#123](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/123) for reference.\n\n## Round Hours\n\nRound to hour, half an hour, quarter of an hour, or just to 2 or 1 fraction digits, e.g. 1.33h. Since version [2.9.5.9](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b1466) and [3.0.5.3](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin/versions#b1467) Obsoletes Maximum Fraction Digits option below.\n\n## (Obsolete) Maximum Fraction Digits\n\nMaximum number of decimals to display after decimal point in hours, e.g. 1.33h.\n\n## Worklog Limit\n\nThis option is designed to workaround OutOfMemory problem caused by huge detailed Time Sheet Report. So if specified, no details will show if worklog count is greater then a specified value.\n\n## Custom days off and holidays\n\nSince version 2.6 it's possible to configure custom holidays in separate Add-On Administration screen - `Timesheet Holidays`.\n\nNote, this is backed up in `jira-config.properties`. E.g.\n\n    jira.timesheet.plugin.holidays=\\\n    1/May/2012 - Labor Day,\\\n    9/May/2012 - Victory Day\n\n\nOr just:\n\n    jira.timesheet.plugin.holidays=1/May/2012, 9/May/2012\n\nDates must be specified in jira default locale and long date format, which are usually `en_US` and `dd/MMM/YYYY`.\n\nSee also issue [#257](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/257) for reference, and issue [#297](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/297) for implemented enhancement.\n\n## Backing properties\n\nFor more information about setting corresponding property in `jira-config.properties`, please see [Advanced JIRA Configuration](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA050/Advanced+JIRA+Configuration)."

      "title": "Frequent Questions",
      "href": "Frequent_Questions",
      "text": "If you have not found your answer here or in [Atlassian Answers](https://answers.atlassian.com/tags/addon-jira-timesheet-plugin/), do not hesitate to write me an [email](mailto:azhdanov@gmail.com) in English, Russian or Czech language at your convenience.\n\n## What license do we need for the add-on on JIRA Server (on-premise)?\n\nYou need the same license type as your JIRA has, particularly number of users in add-on license must match the number of users in JIRA license. See also [Licensing and Pricing](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#licensingandpricing-1).\n\nIf it has Unlimited (100+) users JIRA license, add-on license must be purchased at the JIRA 10000+ tier. See also [JIRA Grandfathering](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/jira#serverlicenses-5)\n\nNote, when you renew Unlimited (100+ users) license to current (non-legacy) tier, please be sure to include Timesheet add-on in your request at the same time.\n\n## Do we need license for our TEST instance to keep plugin active?\n\nYes, you need another license, if you plan to install plugin to on another server (see also [Licensing and Pricing](http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#licensingandpricing-4)), but for TEST server you may use developer license, see how to create developer licenses [here](http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/purchase-licensing#licensing-9).\n\n## Is it possible to extend evaluation license?\n\nYou can generate month evaluation licenses up to 6 times for an add-on, i.e. you can evaluate for half a year in total.  These evaluations were accommodated for long purchasing cycles in some organizations. Please do not abuse it.\n\nYou should be able to generate these licensing manually on [Add-on page](https://my.atlassian.com/addon/try/jira-timesheet-plugin).\n\nThis policy is also documented on the [Marketplace Licensing and Purchasing FAQ](http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#licensingandpricing-3).\n\n## Can I request a quote for purchase?\n\nYes, please go through [Buy License Now](https://my.atlassian.com/purchase/buyaddon?key=jira-timesheet-plugin) at plugin page on [Atlassian Marketplace](https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin), click `Add to Cart` and then `Save this Quote`, which you can pay later when you are ready.\n\n## How much does the license upgrade cost?\n\nSee [order form](https://www.atlassian.com/purchase/addon/jira-timesheet-plugin), which should tell you your actual price when you click on the \"Upgrade\" tab and Enter the license SEN and email address for a current license contact.\n\n## How to see plugin in action after install?\n\nIt is necessary to add timesheet gadget to your dashboard at JIRA Administration - System Dashboard. See also video for more details on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofocpgsf-AY#t=00m51s). Also reports are availabe in Projects menu, for selected project, see Timesheet Report and Project Pivot Report in the most bottom.\n\nNote, you may need to enable Time Tracking also at `JIRA Administration` - `Time Tracking`.\n\n## How to make gadgets and reports show larger time period than 2 months?\n\nSince version 2.4 there is `Maximum Period Limit` [Plugin Configuration](Plugin_Configuration) property.\n\nBefore version 2.4 you need to add the following property to `jira-home/jira-config.properties` and restart JIRA, e.g. for year:\n\n    jira.timesheet.plugin.maxDays = 360\n\nPlease see issue [#169](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/169) for reference, and also [Advanced JIRA Configuration](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA050/Advanced+JIRA+Configuration).\n\n## Problem? Timesheet always shows the current week\n\nFor some reason the timesheet always shows the current week, regardless what has been selected in report configuration page. Report displays current week start and end dates.\n\nThis might be because of misconfigured UI and backend date format, please check [Customising the Look and Feel](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Customizing+the+Look+and+Feel#CustomizingtheLookandFeel-Date/TimeFormats) and make sure your settings are correct.\n\n## Problem? Group Timesheet does not show data\n\nThis might be because does not have required permission. Timesheet by user group checks for `Browse Users` permission, for security reasons, see issue [#125](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/125#comment-2780210) for more details.\n\nPlease see [Global Permissions](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/v3.0/permissions.html#global_permissions) for information about Browse Users permission\n\nAlso since version 2.3.15, there may be no data displayed, even if permissions are there, but project specified in report or gadget configuration. In this case it's necessary to update your project roles to include relevant groups. If project and group are specified, plugin displays worked hours for project members only. And membership is determined by all project roles beside Users. Adding needed groups to Developers role should be sufficient, but you may want to elaborate project roles. Then you may use project roles without groups to get project timesheet.\n\n## Problem? Timesheet does not show anything\n\nThere might be unexpected issues within worked time collecting algorithms, which may be easier to solve with debug logging enabled for plugin. You may edit <JIRA_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties or use temporary logging as described [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Logging+and+Profiling#LoggingandProfiling-logging_temp). Add the following categories, just emit `log4.logger.` if you use temporary logging, or restart JIRA if you edit log4.properties; perform relevant scenario, retrieve logs and send them with your email request for help or attach to bug you create:\n\n    log4j.logger.com.fdu.jira.plugin = DEBUG, console, filelog\n    log4j.additivity.com.fdu.jira.plugin = false\n    \n    log4j.logger.jira.plugin = DEBUG, console, filelog\n    log4j.additivity.jira.plugin = false\n\n    log4j.logger.jira.timesheet.plugin = DEBUG, console, filelog\n    log4j.additivity.jira.timesheet.plugin = false\n\n## We are getting excessive warnings in the log, how is it possible to prevent this to spam our Log?\n\nIt was caused by implementation specifics in previous versions, and did not influence plugin functionality, however is fixed since 2.3.13.\n\nPrior 2.3.13, please see issue [#37](https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/issue/37#comment-2779866) for the information on how to suppress warnings in log\n\n## How to purchase from countries unsupported by Atlassian Marketplace?\n\nNow customers from almost all countries can buy directly from Atlassian Markplace.\n\nThough, if you're from country from [the exception list](http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#generalmarketplacequestions-12), please contact any Altlassian Expert at your preference or from [the list on this page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CUST/Marketplace+-+How+to+Purchase). Someone can help you facilitate the purchase. It should be enough to ask for quote for JIRA Timesheet Reports and Gadgets Plugin to initiate the process.\n\nI may recommend the following Atlassian Experts who help often to purchase Timesheet plugin:\n\n* [K15t Software GmbH](http://www.k15t.com/), located in Germany, contact [here](http://www.k15t.com/company/contact)\n* Pix Software, located in Germany and Netherlands, contact [Arne Schirmacher](mailto:arne.schirmacher@softwaretesting.de)\n* Go2Group, located in Japan and Hong Kong, contact [Brett Taylor](mailto:btaylor@go2group.com)\n* Clearvision, located in Ireland and UK, contact [Neil Butler](mailto:sales@clearvision-cm.com)\n* Valiantys, located in Switzerland, contact [Francois Dussurget](mailto:orders.ch@valiantys.com)\n* [Translucent ApS](http://www.translucent.dk/), located in Denmark and Norway, contact  [Jørn Eriksen](mailto:jorne@mesan.no)\n\n## Is there a reseller program?\n\nPlugin is sold only via [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira-timesheet-plugin). There is 20% discount for Atlassian Experts resellers. For non Atlassian Experts there is no  official reseller program. Resellers can purchase license for their customers at regular basis. See also [Atlassian Marketplace FAQ](http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace) for more details about Atlassian Marketplace.\n\n##  End User License Agreement (\"EULA\")\n\nProvisions of the [Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use](http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace/termsofuse) in which Atlassian designates default end user license terms (the \"Standard EULA Terms\") apply to end users' use of Timesheet Reports and Gadgets for JIRA Add-On.

      "text": "Timesheet Reports and Gadgets Add-On for JIRA extends built-in JIRA timetracking means with two Reports and three Gadgets for JIRA dashboard, JQL function and REST endpoint.\n\n1. Time Sheet Report, provides the most extensive means to analyze users' workload.\n\n    ![Timesheet Report](http://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/wiki/Overview/timesheet_report.png)\n\n    It has classical sheet view by day. Also with numerous Report Configuration parameters it is possible to get few variants of the report. Here is few most interesting to mention:\n\n    * `Show Details` checked by default, shows every worklog, and unchecked, grouped by issue.\n    * `Filter` or `Project` allow to narrow report to arbitrary issues subset.\n    * `Group` or `Role` provide view for subset of users, rather than single user view.\n    * `Month View` report by week instead of default by day.\n    * `Sum Subtasks` sum up hours into parent issues.\n    * `Group By Field` additionally aggregates hours by values of the selected field in a separate section.\n    * `Collapse Field Groups` aggregates hours by values of the field selected in Group by Field option, but across projects.\n    * `Additional Fields` shows as many as you want system and custom fields next to issue details.\n\n2. Project Pivot Report displays a summary of worked hours for project for certain period, where columns a project users (resources) and rows are project issues (tasks). Totals are also displayed: on row - total worked for the issue during the specified period; on column total worked hours by user for the specified period.\n\n    ![Project Pivot Report](http://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/wiki/Overview/pivot_report.png)\n\n    With a little bit playing with Report Configuration it is possible to obtain number of variations of the report.\n\n    * `Show Details` when unchecked allows to see hours grouped by projects.\n    * `Project` or `Filter` allow to narrow report to arbitrary issues subset.\n    * `Group` or `Role` provide view for subset of users instead.\n    * `Month View` report by week instead of default by day.\n    * `Sum Subtasks` sum up hours into parent issues.\n    * `Group By Field` additionally aggregates hours by values of the selected field in a separate section.\n    * `Collapse Field Groups` aggregates hours by values of the field selected in Group by Field option, but across projects.\n    * `Additional Fields` shows as many as you want system and custom fields next to issue details.\n     \n    **Remember**, it is always possible to combine and bookmark needed view. Both reports will always automatically display data for the week back from the current date, unless you specify dates in report configuration.\n\n    Both reports can be exported to Excel to get raw worked hours for other processing.\n\n3. Time Sheet Report can be sent regularly by email, see Subscribe link on report page. Then schedule can adjusted in Issues - Timesheet Subscriptions menu. See also [Email Time Sheet Report](Email_Time_Sheet_Report) for more details.\n\n4. Time Sheet and Project Pivot gadgets for JIRA dashboard corresponding to reports provide convenient way to keep an eye on your or your team workload on day to day basis. It may have different view - by project, by issue, or by group), and navigate through time records:\n\n    ![Gadgets](http://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/wiki/Overview/timesheet-and-pivot-gadgets.png)\n\n    It's also possible to configure gadgets when you add them to your system dashboard, by specifying number of weeks, filter, user or group. With little efforts you might achieve exactly what you need.\n\n    See also [Tips and Tricks](Tips_and_Tricks) for some hints of what you can get of plugin reports and gadgets.\n\n5. Worked Time Chart gadget summarizes hours in Pie Chart. It also may have different view - by issues for single user or by user for group, Project or Role, or custom by any field.\n\n    ![Worked Time Chart](http://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/wiki/Overview/timechart-gadget.png)\n\n6. JQL function workedIssues(fromDate, toDate, userOrGroup) can be used with JIRA Find Issues or via /jira/rest/api/2/search REST endpoint. It returns issues that have a worklog with startDate between specified fromDate and toDate, including. E.g. JQL clause: `key in workedIssues(\"2013/10/14\", \"2013/10/20\", \"jira-developers\")`.\n\n    ![JQL function](http://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet/wiki/Overview/workedissues.png)\n\n7. And finally, /rest/timesheet-gadget/1.0/raw-timesheet.json REST endpoint can be used to get worklog data in JSON or XML format, see [RESTful endpoint](RESTful_endpoint) for more details.\n\nReports are accessible via `Project` menu in JIRA, under `Reports` tab, see `Time Sheet Report` and `Project Pivot Report` there. See also [JIRA Documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Generating+Reports) for more information.
